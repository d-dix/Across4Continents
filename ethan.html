                        <span class="emphasize">The Australian rainforest.</span> We went on a beautiful hike through the jungle. It had just rained, and I was having a lot of fun shaking trees so the leaves would shake water on my sisters head. üå≥ Anyway, we went swimming in a waterhole, explored behind a waterfall, and started back to the car. 
                    </p>
                    <p>On the way back, I noticed <span class="emphasize">a little black thing on me</span>, and when I pulled it off, there was a bit of blood and it stuck to my finger. I wiped it off on a tree and ran to tell my sisters that there might be biting worms on them. I thought maybe they would get worked up and it would be funny. 

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And then. Ok. So <span class="emphasize">they were leaches. And they were everywhere.</span> Everyone in my family realized they had them on their legs and feet, and started trying to pull them off. We figured they were from the water, although Jacob thought he saw one on the ground. My little sister started screaming her head off, then my mom started screaming. Everyone was ripping the leaches off, and there was <span class="emphasize">blood everywhere</span>, but we just kept getting more. Then we realized <span class="emphasize">they were on the ground, ALL AROUND US!!!</span> They were the worm things, and they were so fast and jumping on us!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We all took off running, my little sister screaming,

                        Once, we hiked to the top of a mountain and found a ropes course there. But we weren‚Äôt allowed to do it because we were wearing sandals. Also BTW everyone in Switzerland thinks wearing sandals on hikes is weird.                    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Anyway. We found another ropes course later and I was so excited. Most places in the US only let kids my age do boring ropes courses because ‚ÄúI‚Äôm too young‚Äù. However, this place in Switzerland would let me do the hardest one as long as I could cross the easier ones first.                     </p>
                    <p>
                        When I first started the hardest one, there were a bunch of teenagers in front of us falling off like crazy or getting stuck and having to get rescued. We watched for a long time as they fell off one by one. This course went HIGH up and you had to do lots of stuff like cross obstacles with just your arms or balance on wobbly wooden boards. Seriously, I can‚Äôt believe they let me do it. At the end your soared over a huge lake on a zip-line- and you did the carabiners and stuff with no adult help. I did the whole thing even tho I‚Äôm only ten. I‚Äôm kinda proud of myself.

                        This isn't really a crazy story or anything, but I went wakeboarding for the first time. At first I kept falling down, but once I got the hang of it I didn't want to stop. My arms did tho, they felt like they might fall right off. But I just kept doing it until my arms like actually couldn‚Äôt anymore. I‚Äôd love to go again. 100x.                     </p>
