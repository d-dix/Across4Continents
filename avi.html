                <p>One of my very favorite things on the whole trip was going snorkeling. There were so many <span class="handwriting">colorful&nbsp;fish&nbsp;üê†ü™∏</span> in the water swimming everywhere, all around me! I even saw a big <span class="handwriting">sea turtle</span> taking a nap, and when I got out the captain let us feed the <span class="handwriting">sharks.&nbsp;ü¶à</span> I want to go snorkeling again sometime. It was so so fun. </p>

                    <p>There's something that has been bothering me. What is the difference between a country and a state? I don't get it. California is not a country? But Japan is? And is Europe a country? It just doesn‚Äôt make sense.</p>
